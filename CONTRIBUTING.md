# Contributing

### :tada: First things first, thanks for considering to contribute to sort-files!:tada:

sort-files is a practical way to clean-up your desktop or any other directory and the more contributions it receives, the more practical it becomes.

Following are the guidelines to contribute to sort-files:

1. First, fork the project using the fork button. This will create a copy of the project in your own GitHub profile, so you can make changes on your own copy until you think it's time to make changes to the original.
2. Clone the forked project onto your local machine, so you can commit changes you make locally.
   For cloning the project, make sure you have Git installed on your machine. Then goto your Git console and,
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/sort-files.js
   ```
3. Create an issue (if it doesn't exist already) about the changes you're about to make.
4. Create a new branch for the intended changes.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b <branch-name-to-be-created>
   ```

5. Make local changes to your clone.
6. Commit the changes and push them to the origin (your forked project).
   
   ```sh
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```
   
7. Create a new Pull Request on the original project, mentioning the issue that it solves.
8. Wait for a review.


### And you're done! Just like that! :sparkles::sparkles:
